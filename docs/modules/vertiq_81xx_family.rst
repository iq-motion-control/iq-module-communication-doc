The Vertiq 81-XX family is built for high performance commercial UAV and robotic applications.
These extremely compact, lightweight modules are designed for roboticists with strict space and 
weight requirements. With position sensing and advanced calibration and control algorithms, 
we're able to drive the motor in a way that increases efficiency, torque output, and 
responsiveness. Vertiq motors also output advanced telemetry for motor and vehicle health monitoring.
