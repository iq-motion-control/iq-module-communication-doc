The IQ Vertiq 8108 150Kv is built for high performance commercial UAV and robotic applications. Its default firmware is the **Speed Firmware**.
This extremely compact, lightweight module is designed for roboticists with strict space and 
weight requirements. With position sensing and advanced calibration and control algorithms, 
we're able to drive the motor in a way that increases efficiency, torque output, and 
responsiveness. IQ motors also output advanced telemetry for motor and vehicle health monitoring.
