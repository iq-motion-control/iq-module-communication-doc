        :alt: Fortiq 42XX Family


The Fortiq 42XX module is designed for industrial and robotic applications that 
require maximum torque, precision, and efficiency with minimal vibration. IQ's unique 
hardware design and advanced calibration techniques has allowed us to create the most 
compact and torque-dense industrial servomotor on the market. Vertiq is offering 4 versions 
of the Fortiq: **4125**, **4235**, **4255**, **4275**.

.. note:: 
    The Fortiq has previously been named BLS42 and now they called Fortiq 42XX.   

    While the default firmware for the Fortiq 42XX is the Servo Firmware, it also fully supports the following:
    
    * Step Direction Firmware
    * Speed Firmware
