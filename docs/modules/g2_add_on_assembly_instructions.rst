G2 Add-On Assembly Instructions
===============================
Vertiq’s second generation (G2) motors and ESCs are designed to be modular, accepting a wide range of mechanical and electrical attachments, or “add-ons,” to improve motor performance or introduce new capabilities. 
“Kits” come with both a module and separate add-ons. The assembly instructions for these add-ons are below. Please see the bottom of the page for visual aids as well.


.. note::
    Please see the :ref:`visual aids <_visual_aids>` at the bottom of this page for more information about the add-ons.

Default Kit
===========
Vertiq’s Default Modules allow customers to test and integrate their modules quickly and easily.
These modules are characterized by a side-eject connector board with solder pads that can accept a wide range of power, communication, and LED wires.

Some (not all) Default Modules come as Kits when Vertiq provides a propeller adapter and accompanying screws.
For electrical interface instructions, please visit the Hardware Setup Walkthrough on your product’s page in ReadTheDocs.
For Default Kits, please follow standard propeller adapter instructions provided by your propeller supplier.


Performance Kit
===============
Vertiq’s Performance Kits showcase the module’s peak performance. These are Default Modules that come with a separate rotor cover. Below is a brief description of the rotor cover and assembly instructions. For electrical interface instructions, please visit the Hardware Setup Walkthrough on your product’s page in ReadTheDocs.

**Description**: The rotor cover is fastened to the top of the motor to increase airflow through the rotor and protect the motor from foreign object debris. The parts that make up the Performance Kit’s Rotor Cover include:

- RCM (Qty. 1) - plastic blower fan made of PA 12 glass-filled nylon
- ADP (Qty. 1) - machined aluminum spacer for propeller adapter 
- SCR (Qty. 3) - M2 screws to fasten the RCM to the motor’s rotor

Pro Kit
=======
Vertiq’s Pro Kits are designed to give customers the ability to optimize their propulsion system for their vehicle.
Different combinations of these add-ons will result in higher performance, increased IP rating, and/or new functionality. 
Vertiq’s Pro Module has an IP-sealable stator cover and downward-eject wires already attached to the module.
A number of add-ons, including rotor covers, coil covers, stator sealer, and LEDs, come separately and make up the Pro Kit.
Below is a brief description of the add-ons and assembly instructions.

- ADP (Qty. 1) - machined aluminum spacer for propeller adapter 
- SCR (Qty. 3) - M2 screws to fasten the RCM to the motor’s rotor
- SCN (Qty. 1) - mesh screen to protect from >1mm debris
