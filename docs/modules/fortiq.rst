        :alt: Fortiq M42BLS Family


The IQ Fortiq M42BLS module is designed for industrial and robotic applications that 
require maximum torque, precision, and efficiency with minimal vibration. IQ's unique 
hardware design and advanced calibration techniques has allowed us to create the most 
compact and torque-dense industrial servomotor on the market. IQ is offering 4 versions 
of the Fortiq M42BLS.

.. note:: 
    The Fortiq has previously been named BLS42 and now they called Fortiq M42BLS.   

    While the default firmware for the Fortiq M42BLS0 is the Servo Firmware, it also fully supports the following:
    
    * Step Direction Firmware
    * Speed Firmware
