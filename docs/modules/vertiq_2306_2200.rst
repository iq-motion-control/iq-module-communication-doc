The Vertiq 2306 2200KV is an integrated motor and
controller with a wide range of velocity based applications. Its default firmware is the **Speed Firmware**. It has an open and closed loop controller
designed primarily to drive propeller loads. Its performance is comparable to or better than other 2306
sized motors and can operate at any speed between
-32,000 and 32,000 RPM thanks to its sensored control.

If given thrust coefficients, this controller can be
commanded in units of thrust, seamlessly accepting
values from flight controllers in their native units. An
added benefit is the decoupling of flight controller
gains from motor choice, propeller choice, battery
level, and more. Thrust commands are fed into a
PID velocity controller with a second order polynomial feed forward. This sits on top of a voltage controller, which compensates for varying input voltages.
Finally, the core is a raw PWM controller. Any of the
above controllers can be used by the user.
