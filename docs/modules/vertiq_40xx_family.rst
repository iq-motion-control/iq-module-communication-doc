The Vertiq 40-XX family of modules are built for high performance commercial UAV and robotic applications.
With position sensing and advanced calibration and control algorithms, 
we're able to drive the motor in a way that increases efficiency, torque output, and 
responsiveness. Vertiq motors also output advanced telemetry for motor and vehicle health monitoring.
