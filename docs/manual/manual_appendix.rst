Stop Detection
================
Some features, such as :ref:`Disarming Behavior <advanced_disarming_behavior>` and :ref:`Timeout Behavior <timeout_behavior>` rely on detecting when a module is stopped. This section defines how a stop is detected, and how that 
detection can be configured by advanced users.

A Vertiq module is considered stopped when it has been below its stopping speed continuously for some stopping time. Anytime the moduleâ€™s velocity goes above the 
stopping speed, it will reset the countdown on the stopping time. 

The stopping speed and stopping time can be configured by users using the *Stopped Speed* and *Stopped Time* parameters in the Advanced tab of the IQ Control Center, as shown below.

For example, if the stopping time were 1 second and the stopping speed were 5 rad/s, if the module were spinning at 2 rad/s for 0.5 seconds, then 10 rad/s for 1 second, 
and then 2 rad/s again for another 0.5 seconds, it would not be considered stopped. The countdown was reset when the module went to 10 rad/s. If the module 
stayed at 2 rad/s for 1 second, it would then be considered stopped.
